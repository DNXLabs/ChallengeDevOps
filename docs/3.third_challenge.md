## Third Challenge

Let's start auto scaling our architecture.\
In this session, we've learnt a bit about Auto Scaling and CloudWatch. \
In the next challenge, we will be making use of these resources. \
Now, we will not create our instances manually, but using Auto Scaling. \
In this challenge, you will also need to create a Cloud Watch group, and send your Apache logs to it.

### Below, a summary of your next tasks:

|  | Task |
