# ![Laravel Example App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laravel/art/master/logo-lockup/5%20SVG/2%20CMYK/1%20Full%20Color/laravel-logolockup-cmyk-red.svg)

## Configure the Application

Clone this repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:DNXLabs/ChallengeDevOps.git
```

Switch to the repo folder
```bash
cd ChallengeDevOps
```
Install all the dependencies using composer
```bash
composer install
```

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a new application key
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key
```bash
php artisan jwt:generate
```

Install MySQL
```
Windows: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html
MacOS: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/macos-installation.html
```

Run the database migrations \
(**Make sure you set the correct database connection information in your .env before running the migrations**)

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

If you get the following error:
```bash
SQLSTATE[HY000] [2054] The server requested authentication method unknown to the client (SQL: select * from information_schema.tables where table_schema = mentoring2022 and table_name = migrations and table_type = 'BASE TABLE')
```
Try changing your database root pass:

```bash
ALTER USER 'root'@"localhost" IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOUR_PASS'
```

Start the local development server
```bash
php artisan serve
```
You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. \
This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement
```bash
database/seeds/DummyDataSeeder.php
```
Run the database seeder and you're done
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command
```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
```
